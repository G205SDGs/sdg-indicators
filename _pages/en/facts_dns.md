In 2002, the initial German Sustainability Strategy was published, consisting of individually chosen goals, indicator fields, and postulates.

2017 the national strategy was adjusted as a response to the [Agenda 2030](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/agenda/) of the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The strategy is now called [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability). As part of the adjustments at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included. The Federal Government determined the target values, as well as the indicators, their database, and calculations.

Since 2006 the Federal Statistical Office is assigned by the Federal Government to report every two years about the target achievement of the German Sustainable Development Strategy. The information is published as [indicator report](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Nachhaltigkeitsindikatoren/Publikationen/Downloads-Nachhaltigkeit/indicator-report-0230002189004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile). It is available in a printed and in a digital version. Since 2020 the development of the indicators is also published on the reporting platform.
