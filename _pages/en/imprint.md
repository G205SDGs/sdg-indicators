## Contact

Communication via e-mail may involve security gaps. For example, e-mails may be delayed, read and even manipulated by skilled internet users before they reach the relevant staff members of the Federal Statistical Office. Therefore, only informal contacts are possible via e-mail. Legally binding statements currently cannot be made in this way. Should we receive an e-mail from you, we assume that we are authorised to reply by e-mail. Should this not be the case, we would explicitly ask you to choose a different medium for communication.


## Copyright - general

The following applies for all standard publications of the Federal Statistical Office, either in printed or electronic form, and for the content of this website, including charts and downloadable products, unless additional or other information is given on the product/website itself.

Reproduction and distribution, also of parts, are permitted provided that the source is mentioned.

This applies for any redistribution of texts, data and charts by third parties where the Federal Statistical Office is the copyright owner and holds exclusive publishing rights. Re-use is permitted both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are also no restrictions on distribution by electronic means, via the Internet or in printed form. No express authorisation is required from the Federal Statistical Office. It is, however, required to provide a source note. The Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) shall be named as the publisher in the list of references

Amendments, deletions/abridgements or omissions, redesigns or other modifications shall be identified as such, or a note shall be included in the references stating that the data have been changed, have only been used as the basis for calculation or have been presented in a different form.

Excluded from the temporally and geographically unlimited scope of use are the usage rights of third parties which are explicitly set out in our publications or on our web pages (e.g. photo rights). This also applies to jointly-issued products. There is no general policy here. Each product must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

It is therefore recommended that, when exploiting our data, users ensure that the copyright information is included in the product in question and, if necessary, that they contact the copyright owner given in the imprint.
