There are two sections of this reporting platform. The one where you are currently located displays the indicator set of the [Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) Agenda 2030](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). The other section of the platform provides the indicators of the [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability/) (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). In both sections the time series on the respective indicators can be downloaded by interested visitors.

Next to the search box in the upper right corner of this page there is a direct link to the starting page of the national reporting platform to the indicator section on the German Sustainability Development Strategy: [<img src="https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/assets/img/about/DNS Wheel.png" alt="Wheel">](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io)

Both sets of indicators are organised according to the 17 goals of the UN-Agenda 2030. Thus, the symbols and the colouring of the 17 goals that are used here and on the DNS-part of the reporting platform (figures 1 and 2) are copyright protected by the United Nations.

## Aim and background

The SDGs are nested in the Agenda 2030 which was adopted in 2015 by the UN General Assembly, and thus by all its member states. The Agenda lays the foundation to shape global economic progress in harmony with social justice and within the ecological limits of the planet.

The Federal Statistical Office coordinates and publishes the national data to the SDG indicators for Germany. The national reporting platform for SDG indicators at hand enables the responsible Custodian Agencies to directly download national data for single SDG indicators and integrate them into their global reporting on SDGs (Figure 3). The interested public can find continually updated information on the status of the SDG indicators in Germany and detailed national metadata regarding the calculation methodology of the reported time series.

In some cases, national data for Germany are available with only minor methodological differences from the global specifications made by Custodian Agencies. In other cases, these deviations are larger (for more information, see the “About us” category and [Navigation](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/en/about_navigation) in the Global Metadata section). This may result in a manipulation of the national data provided to the responsible Custodian Agency to ensure international comparability. Therefore, the time series found in the [global SDG database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/) for Germany may differ from the time series provided here.

## Possible Amendments until 2030

The present indicator set is undergoing two major revisions in 2020 (already passed) and 2025. The revisions are co-ordinated by the [IAEG-SDG](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs) (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators). Among other things, during the revisions, new indicators may be added to the set; existing ones may be replacing or even removed. The changes will be implemented as quickly as possible on our reporting platform.

## Technical background

The open source project Open SDG on GitHub offers a standardised reporting platform template for the presentation of national data sets. Any country that wants to take part can use the template. To find out more about it please have a look at [Guidance](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/en/about_guidance/).
